# Jaseto

Jaseto is JSON serializer for Java objects. Unlike other tools like [Jackson serializer](https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-custom-serialization) and GSON, Jaseto:
- provides a comprehensive API
- focuses on exposing an OO system to a text
- does not support deserizaliation
- support cyclic aggregation, making it able to serialize graphs
- is highly customizable


Jaseto is being developed in the context of Research experiments at [I3S laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/) of [Universté Côte d'Azur](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/).
